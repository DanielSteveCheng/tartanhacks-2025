                        <p>With the ever expanding issue of trash in our oceans, DeepClean's goal is to employ
                            computer vision technology with drones and other autonomous equipment to
                            detect and collect marine debris.
                        </p>

                        <h3>33-Billion Pounds of Marine Debris</h3>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>According to the <a href="https://usa.oceana.org/">Oceana Campaign</a>, 
                            every year, an estimated 33-Billion pounds of plastic are deposited 
                            into the ocean.
                        each year. These plastics have the potential to drastically harm human and marine life, 
                        creating a global issue in need of resolution.</p>

                        <p>One of the biggest challenges with cleaning marine debris is their remote
                            location from shores and landmasses. As such, manned study and clean-up is 
                            incredibly difficult.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our mission is to clean the oceans with unmanned machines equipped with computer vision
                            technology. By removing the need for direct human observation, the process
                            of cleaning the world's oceans can be made that much easier.

                        <p> DeepClean utilizes OpenCV to scan a live video feed and return the location
                            of any trash detected. This location data will be processed by other autonomous
                            machines to find and clean debris. Together, our technology can automate the
                            collection of trash in the ocean.
